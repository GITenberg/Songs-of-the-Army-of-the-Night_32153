<p class="poetry">&ldquo;My sweet, my child, through all this
night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of dark and wind and rain,<br />
Where thunder crashes, and the light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sears the bewildered brain,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;It is your face, your lips, your eyes<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I see rise up; I hear<br />
Your voice that sobs and calls and cries,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or shrills and mocks at fear.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O this that&rsquo;s mine is yours as
well,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For side by side our feet<br />
Trod through these bitter brakes of hell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Take it, my child, my sweet!&rdquo;</p>

11</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>A few words of preface seem necessary in sending out this
little book.&nbsp; It is to be looked on as the product of the
life of a social worker in England, in his travels, and in
Australia.&nbsp; The key-note of the First
Part&mdash;&ldquo;England&rdquo;&mdash;is desperation, or, if any
hope, then &ldquo;desperate hope.&rdquo;&nbsp; A friend once
reported to me a saying of Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s, that he did
not believe in any man of intelligence taking a desperate view of
the social problem in England.&nbsp; I am afraid that saying
relegates me to the ranks of the fools, but I am content to
remain there.&nbsp; I believe that never since 1381, which is the
date of the Peasants&rsquo; Revolt, has England presented such a
spectacle of the happiness of the tens, of the misery of the
millions.&nbsp; It is not by any means the artisan, or the
general or the agricultural labourer, who is the only
sufferer.&nbsp; All society groans under the slavery of
stupendous toil and a pittance wage.&nbsp; The negro slavery of
the Southern States of America was better than the white slavery
of to-day all over the earth, but more particularly in Europe and
in America.&nbsp; Capitalism is built on the dreadful wrong of
recompensing Labour, not according to the worth of its work, but
according to the worth of its members in the market of unlimited
competition, and that soon comes to mean the payment of what will
hold body and soul together when in the enjoyment of health and
strength.&nbsp; Landlordism is built on the dreadful wrong of
sharing with Capitalism the plunder of Labour.&nbsp; Why are <!--
page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>rents high in Australia?&nbsp; Because here Labour is
scarcer, its wages correspondingly higher, and therefore
Landlordism steps in to filch from Labour its hard-won comforts,
and once more reduce it to the necessities of existence.&nbsp;
The American slavers had to spend more in housing and keeping any
fixed number of their slaves in serviceable condition than
Capitalism spends in wages.&nbsp; Capitalism and Landlordism,
like good Christian Institutions, leave the living to keep alive
their living, and the dead to bury their dead.&nbsp; This cannot
continue for ever.&nbsp; At least all the intelligent portion of
the community will grow to see the injustice and attempt to
abolish it.&nbsp; But when will the great mass of unintelligent
people who have won a large enough share of the plunder of their
fellows to minister to their own comforts&mdash;when will these,
also, awake and see?&nbsp; England will realize the desperation
of her social problem when its desperation is shown her by fire
and blood&mdash;then, and not till then!&nbsp; What shall teach
her her sins to herself is what is even now teaching her her sins
to Ireland.</p>
<p>I make no apology for several poems in the First Part which
are fierce, which are even blood-thirsty.&nbsp; As I felt I
wrote, and I will not lessen the truth of what inspired those
feelings by eliminating or suppressing the record of them.&nbsp;
Rather, let me ask you, whoever you be, to imagine what the cause
was, from the effect in one who was (unhappily) born and bred
into the dominant class, and whose chief care and joy in life was
in the pursuit of a culture which draws back instinctively from
the violent and the terrible.&nbsp; I will go further.&nbsp; I
will arraign my country and my day, because their iniquity would
not let me follow out the laws of my nature, which were for
luminosity and quiet, for the wide and genial view, but made me
&ldquo;take <!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>arms against a sea of
troubles,&rdquo; hoping only too often &ldquo;by opposing to end
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, we make no apology for bloody sweat and
for tears of fire wrung out of us in the Gethsemane and on the
Calvary of our country: we make no apology to those whom we have
the right to curse.</p>
<p>In the Second Part&mdash;&ldquo;Here and There,&rdquo; the
record of a short trip in the East&mdash;the sight of the sin
which England has committed not only against herself, against
Ireland, against Scotland, but against India, against China,
against the sweetest and gentlest people in the earth, the
Japanese&mdash;the sight of this, and of the signs of
England&rsquo;s doom, the punishment for the abuse of the
greatest trust any modern nation has had given to her, inspires a
hatred which only that punishment can appease.&nbsp; In the Third
Part&mdash;&ldquo;Australia&rdquo;&mdash;there is neither
ferocity nor blood-thirstiness.&nbsp; Its key-note is hope, hope
that dreads but does not despair.</p>
<p>I may add that in this edition I have sacrificed all merely
personal aspects of the poems to attempt to give the book a more
complete totality.&nbsp; We know well enough that allowance will
rarely be made for any of these things: that our plea for
comprehension will too often be an idle one.&nbsp; None the less
we make it, for the sake of those who are willing to attempt to
realize the social problem and to seek within themselves what
they can do for its solution.&nbsp; We have no care whatever as
to what view they take of it.&nbsp; Let them be with us or
against us, it matters not, if only they will make this effort,
if only they will ponder it in their hearts.&nbsp; Ninety-nine
out of a hundred of us are concerned in this problem.&nbsp; We
are all of us true sons of Labour who have suffered the robbery
of the wages of Competition.&nbsp; One word more.&nbsp; The
Australian is apt to deprecate the socialism of the European <!--
page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>or the American.&nbsp; The darker aspects of the
European or American civilization are not striking here.&nbsp;
They are here; they are more than incipient, very much more; but
they are not striking.&nbsp; Let such an one pause.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We speak of that which we do know,&rdquo; and, for the
rest, not only do we bid &ldquo;him that has ears, to
hear,&rdquo; but &ldquo;him that has eyes, to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brothers all over the earth, brothers and sisters, you of that
silent company whose speech is only in the unknown deeds of love,
the unknown devotions, the unknown heroisms, it is to you we
speak!&nbsp; Our heart is against your heart; you can feel it
beat.&nbsp; Soul speaks to soul through lips whose utterance is a
need.&nbsp; In your room alone, in your lonely walks, in the
still hours of day and night, we will be with you.&nbsp; We will
speak with you, we will plead with you, for these piteous
ones.&nbsp; In the evening trees you shall hear the sound of our
weeping.&nbsp; Our sobs shall shake in the wind of wintry
nights.&nbsp; We are the spirit of those piteous ones, the
wronged, the oppressed, the robbed, the murdered, and we bid you
open your warm heart, your light-lit soul to us!&nbsp; We will
thrill you with the clarion of hate and defiance and despair in
the tempest of land and sea.&nbsp; You shall listen to us there
also.&nbsp; We will touch your eyes and lips with fire.&nbsp; No,
we will never let you go, till you are ours and theirs!&nbsp; And
you too, O sufferers, you too shall stay with us, and shall have
comfort.&nbsp; Look, we have suffered, we have agonized, we have
longed to hasten the hour of rest.&nbsp; But beyond the darkness
there is light, beyond the turbulence peace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Courage, and be true to one another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>We bid you hope</i>!&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter and see and listen.&nbsp; On the ground<br />
Men sit or stand, enter or disappear,<br />

<p class="poetry">One answers you.&nbsp; &ldquo;You ask who
gathers here?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Companions!&nbsp; Generals we have none, nor
chief.<br />
What need is there?&nbsp; The plan is all so clear&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; The future&rsquo;s hope, the present&rsquo;s grim
relief!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Food for us all, and clothes, and roofs
come first.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The means to gain them?&nbsp; This, our leaguered

The hatred of the robber rich accursed<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Beyond the present&rsquo;s faith, the
future&rsquo;s hope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Points to the dawning hour when all shall be<br />
But one.&nbsp; The man condemned shall fit the rope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the hangman&rsquo;s neck, and both be
free!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The sun then rises on a happier land<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Wealth and Labour sound but as one word.<br />
We drill, we train, we arm our leaguered band.<br />

Out we steal each one,<br />

<h3>IN THE STREET.<br />
LORD ----.</h3>
<p class="poetry">You have done well, we say it.&nbsp; You are
dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, of the man that with the right hand takes<br />
Less than the left hand gives, let it be said<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He has done something for our wretched sakes.<br />
For those to whom you gave their daily bread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rancid with God-loathed &ldquo;charity,&rdquo; their
drink<br />
Putrid with man-loathed &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; we bow our head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grateful, as the great hearse goes by, and think.<br
/>
Yes, you have fed the flesh and starved the soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thousands of us; you have taught too well<br />
The rich are little gods beyond control,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save of your big God of the heaven and hell.<br />
We thank you.&nbsp; This was pretty once, and right.<br />
Now it wears rather thin.&nbsp; My lord, good night!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;LIBERTY!&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Liberty!&rdquo;&nbsp; Is that the cry,
then?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We have heard it oft of yore.<br />
Once it had, we think, a meaning;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us hear it now no more.</p>
<p class="poetry">We have read what history tells us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of its heroes, martyrs too.<br />
Doubtless they were very splendid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they&rsquo;re not for me and you.</p>
<p class="poetry">There were Greeks who fought and perished,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Won from Persians deathless graves.<br />
Had <i>we</i> lived then, we&rsquo;re aware that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;d have been those same Greeks&rsquo;
slaves!</p>
<p class="poetry">Then a Roman came who loved us;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C&aelig;sar gave men tongues and swords.<br />
Crying &ldquo;Liberty,&rdquo; they fought him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cato and his cut-throat lords.</p>
<p class="poetry">When he&rsquo;d give a broader franchise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lift the mangled nations bowed,<br />
Crying &ldquo;Liberty!&rdquo; they killed him,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Brutus and his pandar crowd.</p>
<p class="poetry">We have read what history tells us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O the truthful memory clings!<br />
Tacitus, the chartered liar,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gloating over poisoned kings!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Liberty!&rdquo;&nbsp; The stale cry
echoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Past snug homesteads, tinsel thrones,<br />
Over smoking fields and hovels,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Murdered peasants&rsquo; bleaching bones.</p>
<p class="poetry">That&rsquo;s the cry that mocked us madly,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toiling in our living graves,<br />
When hell-mines sent up the chorus:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Britons never shall be
slaves</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Liberty!&rdquo;&nbsp; We care not for
it!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What we care for&rsquo;s food, clothes, homes,<br />
For our dear ones toiling, waiting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For the time that never comes!</p>

(To LORD L----.)</h3>
<p class="poetry">Will you not buy?&nbsp; She asks you, my lord,
you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who know the points desirable in such.<br />
She does not say that she is perfect.&nbsp; True,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s not too pleasant to the sight or
touch.<br />
But then&mdash;neither are you!</p>
<p class="poetry">Her cheeks are rather fallen in; a mist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Glazes her eyes, for all their hungry glare.<br />
Her lips do not breathe balmy when they&rsquo;re kissed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet she&rsquo;s not more loathsome than, I
swear,<br />
Your grandmother at whist.</p>
<p class="poetry">My lord, she will admit, and need not frame<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Excuses for herself, that she&rsquo;s not chaste.<br
/>
First a young lover had her; then she came<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From one man&rsquo;s to another&rsquo;s arms, with
haste.<br />
Your mother did the same.</p>
<p class="poetry">Moreover, since she&rsquo;s married, once or
twice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She&rsquo;s sold herself for certain things at
night,<br />
To sell one&rsquo;s body for the highest price<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of social ease and power, all girls think right.<br
/>
Your sister did it thrice.</p>
<p class="poetry">What, you&rsquo;ll not buy?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
curse at her instead?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her children are alone, at home, quite near.<br />
These winter streets, so gay at nights, &rsquo;tis said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have &rsquo;ticed the wanton out.&nbsp; <i>She could
not hear</i><br />
<i>Her children cry for bread</i>!</p>
<h3>TO THE GIRLS OF THE UNIONS.</h3>
<p class="poetry">Girls, we love you, and love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Asks you to give again<br />
That which draws it above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beautiful, without stain.</p>

<p class="poetry">Give to the man who turns<br />

Back from the plough that burns,<br />

<p class="poetry">In the chill grey summer dawn-light<br />

The rattling wheels are all silent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No friend his fellow greets.</p>

A bayonet hangs by his side, and<br />

<h3>THE CAGED EAGLE.</h3>
<p class="poetry">. . .&nbsp; I went the other day<br />
To see the birds and beasts they keep enmewed<br />
In the London Zoo.&nbsp; One of the first I saw&mdash;<br />
One of the first I noticed, was an eagle.<br />
Ragged, befouled, within his iron bars<br />
He sat without a movement or a sound,<br />
And, when I stood and pitying looked at him,<br />
I saw his great sad eyes that winkless gazed<br />
Out to the horizon sky.&nbsp; I passed from there,<br />
And walked about the gardens, hither and thither,<br />
Till all the afternoon was spent.&nbsp; Returning then<br />
To seek my home, again by chance I passed<br />
The eagle&rsquo;s cage, and stood again, and looked,<br />
And saw his great sad eyes that winkless gazed<br />
Out to the horizon sky.&nbsp; So I went home . . .<br />
<i>The eagle is Ireland</i>!</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand that never wearied in the fight,<br />
Till, through the dark&rsquo;s despair, the dawn&rsquo;s

It rose, that vision of forgotten days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ireland, a nation in her right and might,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fearless of the lightning as the Light,&mdash;<br

Freedom, the noon-tide sun that shines and stays!<br />
O brave, O pure, O hater of the wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The wrong that is as one with England&rsquo;s
name,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyranny with cant of liberty, and shame<br />
With boast of righteousness), to you belong<br />

43</span>AN &ldquo;ASSASSIN.&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="poetry">. . . They caught them at the bend.&nbsp; He
and his son<br />
Sat in the car, revolvers in their laps.<br />
From either side the stone-walled wintry road<br />
There flashed thin fire-streaks in the rainy dusk.<br />
The father swayed and fell, shot through the chest.<br />
The son was up, but one more fire-streak leaped<br />
Close from the pitch-black of a thick-set bush<br />
Not five yards from him, and lit all the face<br />
Of him whose sweetheart walked the Dublin streets<br />
For lust of him who gave one yell and fell<br />
Flat on the stony road, a sweltering corse.<br />
Then they came out, the men who did this thing,<br />
And looked upon their hatred&rsquo;s retribution,<br />
While heedlessly the rattling car fled on.<br />
Grey-haired old wolf, your letch for peasants&rsquo; blood,<br />
For peasants&rsquo; sweat turned gold and silver and bronze,<br
/>
Is done, is done, for ever and ever is done!<br />
O foul young fox, no more young girls&rsquo; fresh lips<br />
Shall bruise and bleed to cool your lecher&rsquo;s lust.<br />
Slowly from out the great high terraced clouds<br />
The round moon sailed.&nbsp; The dead were left alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">* * * * *</p>
<p class="poetry">I talked with one of those who did this
thing,<br />
A coughing half-starved lad, mere skin and bone.<br />
I said: &ldquo;They found upon those dead men, gold.<br />
Why did you not take it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then with proud-raised
head,<br />
He looked at me and said: &ldquo;<i>Sorr</i>, <i>we&rsquo;re not
thaves</i>!&rdquo;</p>

mangled earth</i>,<br />

<p class="poetry">Crouched in the terrible land,<br />
The circle of pitiless ice,<br />
With frozen bloody feet<br />
And her pestilential summer&rsquo;s<br />
Fever-throb in her brow,<br />
Look, in her deep slow eyes<br />
The mists of her sleep of faith<br />
Stir, and a gleam of light,<br />
The ray of a blood-red sun,<br />
Beams out into the dusk.<br />
From far away, from the west,<br />
From the east, from the south, there come<br />
Faint sweet breaths of the breeze<br />
Of plenteous warmth and light.<br />
And she moves, and around her neck<br />
She feels the iron-scaled Snake<br />
Whose fangs suck at the heart<br />
Hid by her tattered dress,<br />
By her lean and hanging teat.<br />
Russia, O land of faith,<br />
O realm of the ageless Slav,<br />
O oppressed one of eternity,<br />

Peerless haters of wrong,<br />
Byrons and Shelleys, what?<br />
They stand great famous names,<br />
Demi-gods to their own,<br />
Shadows far off, alien<br />
To us and ours for ever.<br />
Those who love them and hate<br />
The crime, the injustice they hated,<br />
What can they do but shout,<br />
Win a name from our woes,<br />
And leave us just as we were?<br />

Drill and drill and drill!<br />
Then when the day is come,<br />
When the royal battle-flag&rsquo;s up,<br />
When blood has been spilled in vain<br />
In timid half-hearted war,<br />
Then let the Cromwell rise,<br />
The simple, the true-souled man;<br />
Then let Grant come forth,<br />
The calm, the determined comrade,<br />
But deep in their hearts one hate,<br />
Deep in their souls one thought,<br />
To bring the iniquity low,<br />
To make the People free!<br />
Ah, for such as these<br />
We with the same heart-hate,<br />
We with the same soul-thought,<br />
Will fall to our destined places<br />

<h3>TO THE ARTISTS.</h3>
<p class="poetry">You tell me these great lords have raised up
Art:<br />
I say they have degraded it.&nbsp; Look you,<br />
When ever did they let the poet sing,<br />
The painter paint, the sculptor hew and cast,<br />
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>The music raise her heavenly voice, except<br />
To praise them and their wretched rule o&rsquo;er men?<br />
Behold our English poets that were poor<br />
Since these great lords were rich and held the state:<br />
Behold the glories of the German land,<br />
Poets, musicians, driven, like them, to death<br />
Unless they&rsquo;d tune their spirits&rsquo; harps to play<br />
Drawing-room pieces for the chattering fools<br />
Who aped the taste for Art or for a leer.<br />
Go to, no Art was ever noble yet,<br />
Noble and high, the speech of godlike men,<br />
When fetters bound it, be they gold or flowers.<br />
All that is noblest, highest, greatest, best,<br />
Comes from the Galilean peasant&rsquo;s hut, comes from<br />
The Stratford village, the Ayrshire plough, the shop<br />
That gave us Chaucer, the humble Milton&rsquo;s trade&mdash;<br
/>
Bach&rsquo;s, Mozart&rsquo;s, great Beethoven&rsquo;s,&mdash;And
these are they<br />
Who knew the People, being what they knew!<br />
Go to, if in the future years no strain,<br />
No picture of earth&rsquo;s glory like to what<br />
Your Artists raised for that small clique or this<br />
Of supercilious imbecilities&mdash;<br />
O if no better demi-gods of Art<br />
Can rise save those whose barbarous tinsel yet<br />
Makes hideous all the beauty of old homes&mdash;<br />
Then let us seek the comforts of despair<br />
In democratic efforts dead and gone:<br />
Weep with Pheideian Athens, sigh an hour<br />
With Raffaelle&rsquo;s Florence, beat the head and breast<br />
O&rsquo;er Shakspere&rsquo;s England that from Milton&rsquo;s
took<br />
In lips the name that leaped from lead and flame<br />
From out her heart against the Spanish guns!</p>
<h3>&ldquo;ONE AMONG SO MANY.&rdquo;</h3>
<p class="poetry">. . .&nbsp; In a dark street she met and spoke
to me,<br />
Importuning, one wet and mild March night.<br />

<!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Parents that railed; London; the child born dead;<br />
A seamstress then, one of some fifty girls<br />
&ldquo;Taken on&rdquo; a few months at a dressmaker&rsquo;s<br />
In the crush of the &ldquo;season;&rdquo; thirteen shillings a
week!<br />
The fashionable people&rsquo;s dresses done,<br />
And they flown off, these fifty extra girls<br />
Sent&mdash;to the streets: that is, to work that gives<br />
Scarcely enough to buy the decent clothes<br />
Respectable employers all demand<br />
Or speak dismissal.&nbsp; Well, well, well, we know!<br />
And she&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Why</i>, <i>I have gone on down and
down</i>,<br />
<i>And there&rsquo;s the gutter</i>, <i>look</i>, <i>that I shall
die in</i>!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;where hope of all but
that<br />
Is gone, &rsquo;tis time, I think, life were gone too.&rdquo;<br
/>
She looks at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>That I should kill
myself</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;That you should kill yourself.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That
would be sin</i>,<br />
<i>And God would punish me</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And will not
God<br />
Punish for this?&rdquo;&nbsp; She pauses: then whispers:<br />
&ldquo;<i>No</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>He will forgive me</i>, <i>for He
knows</i>!&rdquo;<br />
I laughed aloud: &ldquo;<i>And you</i>,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;<i>and you</i>,<br />
<i>Who are so good</i>, <i>so noble</i>&rdquo; . . .&nbsp;
&ldquo;Noble?&nbsp; Good?&rdquo;<br />
I laughed aloud, the great sob in my throat.<br />
O my poor darling, O my little lost sheep<br />
Of this vast flock that perishes alone<br />
Out in the pitiless desert!&mdash;Yet she&rsquo;d speak:<br />
She&rsquo;d ask me: she&rsquo;d entreat: she&rsquo;d
demonstrate.<br />
O I must not say that! I must believe!<br />
Who made the sea, the leaves so green, the sky<br />
So big and blue and pure above it all?<br />
O my poor darling, O my little lost sheep,<br />
Entreat no more and demonstrate no more;<br />
For I believe there <i>is</i> a God, a God<br />
Not in the heaven, the earth, or the waters; no,<br />
But in the heart of man, on the dear lips<br />
Of angel women, of heroic men!<br />
O hopeless wanderer that would not stay,<br />
(&ldquo;<i>It is too late</i>, <i>I cannot rise
again</i>!&rdquo;)<br />
O saint of faith in love behind the veils,<br />
(&ldquo;<i>You must believe in God</i>, <i>for you are
good</i>!&rdquo;),<br />
O sister who made holy with your kiss,<br />
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

There in the hideous infamous London streets<br />
My cheek, and made my soul a sacred place,<br />

<h3>THE NEW LOCKSLEY HALL.<br />

<p class="poetry">Comrade, yet a little further I would go before
the night<br />
Closes round and chills in darkness all the glorious sunset
light&mdash;<br />
Yet a little, by the cliff there, till the stately home I see<br

Of the man who once was with us, comrade once with you and me!<br
/>
Nay, but leave me, pass alone there; stay awhile and gaze
again<br />
On the various-jewelled waters and the dreamy southern main,<br
/>
For the evening breeze is sighing in the quiet of the hills<br />
Moving down in cliff and terrace to the singing sweet
sea-rills,<br />
While the river, silent-stealing, thro&rsquo; the copse and
thro&rsquo; the lea<br />
Winds her waveless way eternal to the welcome of the sea.<br />
Yes, within that green-clad homestead, gardened grounds and
velvet ease<br />
Of a home where culture reigneth and the chambers whisper
peace,<br />
Is the man, the seer and singer, who (ah, years and years
away!)<br />
Lifted up a face of gladness at the breaking of the day.<br />
For the noontide&rsquo;s desperate ardours that had seen the
Roman town<br />

storm,<br />
Fluttering skylark in the breakers, caught and smothered by the

And had closed those eyes heroic, weary for the final peace.<br
/>
Byron maimed and maddened, strangled in the anguish that was
Greece&mdash;<br />
For this noontide passed to darkness, brooding doubt and wild
dismay,<br />
Where the silly sparrows chirruped and the eagles swooped
away,<br />
Till once more the trampled Peoples and the murdered soul of
man<br />
Raised a haggard face half-wondering where the new-born day
began,<br />
Where the sign of Faith&rsquo;s renewal, Faith&rsquo;s, and
Hope&rsquo;s, and Love&rsquo;s, outgrew<br />
In the golden sun arising; and we hailed it, we and you!<br />
O you hailed it, and your heart beat, and your pretty
woman&rsquo;s lays,<br />
In the fathomless vibration of our rapturous amaze,<br />
Died for ever on your harpstrings, and you rose and struck a
chord<br />
High, full, clear, heroic, godlike, &ldquo;for the glory of the
Lord!&rdquo;<br />
Noble words you spoke; we listened; and we dreamed the day had
come<br />
When the faith of God and Christ should sound one cry with
Man&rsquo;s freedom&mdash;<br />
When the men who stood beside us, eager with hell&rsquo;s troops
to cope,<br />
Radiant, thrilled exultant, proud, with the magnificence of
hope!<br />
&ldquo;Forward! forward!&rdquo; ran our watch-word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forward! forward!&rdquo; by our side<br />
You gave back the glorious summons.&nbsp; Would that day that you
had died!<br />

on your face,<br />

With the great Cause in your heart and with the war-shout on your

Better to have fallen charging, having known the nobler time,<br

In the fiery cheer and impulse of our serried
battle-line&mdash;<br />
Than to stand and watch your comrades, in the hail of fire and

Up the slopes and thro&rsquo; the smoke-clouds, thro&rsquo; the

On our bayonets bristling brightly as we carry the redoubt!<br />
O half-hearted, pusillanimous, faltering heart and fuddled
brain<br />
That remembered Egypt&rsquo;s flesh-pots, and turned back and
dreamed again&mdash;<br />
Left the plain of blood and battle for the quiet of the hills,<br

And the sunny soft contentment that the woody homestead fills.<br

There you sat and sang of Egypt, of its sober solid graves,<br />
(Pyramids, you call them, Sphinxes), mortared with the blood of
slaves,<br />
Houses, streets and stately palaces, the mart, the regal stew<br

Where freedom &ldquo;broadens down&rdquo; so slow it stops with
lords and you!<br />
O you mocked at our confusion, O you told us of our crimes,<br />
Us ungentle, not like warriors of the sweet idyllic times,<br />
Flowers of eunuch-hearted kings and courts where pretty poet
knights<br />

Of the wringers of his heart&rsquo;s-blood from the
peasant&rsquo;s sunless days,<br />
Of the lord and the land-owner, of the rich man who has bound<br

Labour on the wheel to break him, strew his rent limbs on the
ground,<br />
With a vulture eye aglare on brothers, sisters that he had,<br />
Crying, &ldquo;Troops and guns to shoot them, if the hunger drive
them mad!&rdquo;<br />
Coward, faithless, unbelieving, that had courage but to take<br

What of pleasure and of beauty men have won for manhood&rsquo;s
sake,<br />
Blustering long and loudest at the hideousness and pain<br />
These you praise have brought upon us; blustering long and loud

At our agony and anguish in this desperate fight of ours,<br />
Grappling with anarch custom and the darkness and the powers!<br

(<i>Melbourne</i>.)</h3>
<p class="poetry">I came to buy a book.&nbsp; It was a shop<br />
Down in a narrow quiet street, and here<br />
They kept, I knew, these socialistic books.<br />
I entered.&nbsp; All was bare, but clean and neat.<br />
The shelves were ranged with unsold wares; the counter<br />
Held a few sheets and papers.&nbsp; Here and there<br />
Hung prints and calendars.&nbsp; I rapped, and straight<br />
A young girl came out through the inner door.<br />
She had a clear and simple face; I saw<br />
She had no beauty, loveliness, nor charm,<br />
But, as your eyes met those grey light-lit eyes<br />
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Like to a mountain spring so pure, you thought:<br />
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d be a clever man who looked, and lied!&rdquo;<br
/>
I asked her for the book. . . .&nbsp; We spoke a little. . . .<br
/>
Her words were as her face was, as her eyes.<br />
Yes, she&rsquo;d read many books like this of mine:<br />
Also some poets, Shelley, Byron too,<br />
And Tennyson, but &lsquo;poets only dreamed!&rsquo;<br />
Thus, then, we talked, until by chance I spoke<br />
A phrase and then a name.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas &ldquo;Henry
George.&rdquo;<br />
Her face lit up.&nbsp; O it was beautiful,<br />
Or never woman&rsquo;s face was!&nbsp; &ldquo;Henry
George?&rdquo;<br />
She said.&nbsp; And then a look, a flush, a smile,<br />
Such as sprung up in Magdalen&egrave;&rsquo;s cheek<br />
When some voice uttered Jesus, made her angel.<br />
She turned and pointed up the counter.&nbsp; I,<br />
Loosing mine eyes from that ensainted face,<br />
Looked also.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas a print, a common print,<br />
The head and shoulders of some man.&nbsp; She said,<br />
Quite in a whisper: &ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s him</i>, <i>Henry
George</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Darling, that in this life of wrong and woe,<br
/>
The lovely woman-soul within you brooded<br />
And wept and loved and hated and pitied,<br />
And knew not what its helplessness could do,<br />
Its helplessness, its sheer bewilderment&mdash;<br />
That then those eyes should fall, those angel eyes,<br />
On one who&rsquo;d brooded, wept, loved, hated, pitied,<br />
Even as you had, but therefrom had sprung<br />
A hope, a plan, a scheme to right this wrong,<br />
And make this woe less hateful to the sun&mdash;<br />
And that pure soul had found its Master thus<br />
To listen to, remember, watch and love,<br />
And trust the dawn that rose up through the dark:<br />
O this was good<br />
For me to see, as for some weary hopeless<br />
Longer and toiler for &ldquo;the Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;<br />
To stand some lifeless twilight hour, and hear,<br />
There in the dim-lit house of Lazarus,<br />
Mary who said: &ldquo;Thus, thus, he looked, he spake,<br />
The Master!&rdquo;&mdash;So to hear her rapturous words,<br />
And gaze upon her up-raised heavenly face!</p>

We praise you, worker, thinker, poet, seer!<br />
Man of the People,&mdash;faithful in all parts,<br />

93</span>A FOOL.<br />
(<i>Brisbane</i>).</h3>
<p class="poetry">He asked me of my friend&mdash;&ldquo;<i>a
clever man</i>;<br />
<i>Such various talent</i>, <i>business</i>,
<i>journalism</i>;<br />
<i>A pen that might some day have sent out</i>
&lsquo;<i>leaders</i>&rsquo;<br />
<i>From our greatest newspapers</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, all
this,<br />
All this,&rdquo; I said.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>And yet he will not
rise</i>?<br />
<i>He&rsquo;ll stay a</i> &ldquo;<i>comp.</i>,&rdquo; <i>a
printer all his life</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
I said: &ldquo;Just that, a workman all his life.&rdquo;<br />
But, as my questioner was a business man,<br />
One of the sons of Capital, a sage<br />
Whose practicality saw I can suppose<br />
Quite to his nose-tip even his finger-ends,<br />
I vouchsafed explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;This young man<br />
My friend, was born and bred a workman.&nbsp; All<br />
His heart and soul (And men have hearts and souls<br />
Other than those the doctor proses of,<br />
The parson prates of, and both make their trade)<br />
Were centred in his comradeship and love.<br />
His friends, his &lsquo;chums&rsquo;, were workmen, and the
girl<br />
He wooed, and made a happy wife and mother,<br />
Had heart and soul like him in whence she sprung.<br />
Observe now!&nbsp; When he came to think and read,<br />
He saw (it seemed to him he saw) in what<br />
Capitalists, Employers, men like you,<br />
Think and call &lsquo;justice&rsquo; in your inter-dealings,<br
/>
Some slight mistakes (I fancy <i>he&rsquo;d</i> say
&lsquo;wrongs&rsquo;)<br />
Whereby his order suffered.&nbsp; So he wonders:<br />
&lsquo;<i>Cannot we change this</i>?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he tries
and tries,<br />
Knowing his fellows and adapting all<br />
His effort in the channels that they know.<br />
You understand?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s &lsquo;only an
Unionist!&rsquo;<br />
Now for the second point.&nbsp; This man believes<br />
That these mistakes&mdash;these wrongs (we&rsquo;ll pass the
word)<br />
Spring from a certain thing called &lsquo;competition&rsquo;<br
/>
Which you (and I) know is a God-given thing<br />
Whereby the fittest get up to the top<br />
(That&rsquo;s I&mdash;or you) and tread down all the others.<br
/>
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>Well, this man sees how by this God-given thing<br />
He has the chance to use his extra wits<br />
And clamber up: he sees how others have&mdash;<br />
(Like you&mdash;or me; my father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s father<br
/>
Was a market-gardener and, I trust, a good one).<br />
He sees, moreover, how perpetually<br />
Each of his fellows who has extra wits<br />
Has used them as the fox fallen in the well<br />
Used the confiding goat, and how the goats<br />
More and more wallow there and stupefy,<br />
Robbed of the little wit the hapless crowd<br />
Had in their general haplessness.&nbsp; Well, then<br />
This man of mine (This is against all law,<br />
Human, divine and natural, I admit)<br />
Prefers to wallow there and not get out,<br />
Except they all can!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve made quite a tale<br />
About what is quite simple.&nbsp; Yet &rsquo;tis curious,<br />
As I see you hold.&nbsp; Now frankly tell me, will you,<br />
What do you think of him?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;<i>He is a
fool</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;He is a fool?&nbsp; There is no doubt of it!<br />
But I am told that it was some such fool<br />
Came once from Galilee, and ended on<br />
A criminal&rsquo;s cross outside Jerusalem,&mdash;<br />
And that this fool, he and his criminal&rsquo;s cross,<br />
Broke up an Empire that seemed adamant,<br />
And made a new world which, renewed again,<br />
Is Europe still.<br />
He is a fool!&nbsp; And it was some such fool<br />
Drudged up and down the earth these later years,<br />
And wrote a Book the other fools bought up<br />
In tens of thousands, calling it a Gospel.<br />
And this fool too, and the fools that follow him,<br />
Or hold with him, why, he and they shall all<br />
End in the mad-house, or the gutter, where<br />
They&rsquo;ll chew the husk of their mad dreams, and die!<br />
For what are their follies but dreams?&nbsp; They have
<i>done</i> nothing,<br />
And never will! . . .<br />
One moment!&nbsp; I have just a word to say.<br />
How comes it, tell me, friend, six weeks ago<br />
A &lsquo;comp.&rsquo; was sent a-packing for a cause<br />
His fellows thought unjust, and that same night<br />
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>(Or, rather, the next morning) in comes one<br />
To tell you (quite politely) that unless<br />
That &lsquo;comp.&rsquo; was setting at his frame, they feared<br
/>
One of our greatest newspapers would not go<br />
That day a harbinger of light and leading<br />
To gladden and instruct its thousands?&nbsp; And,<br />
If I remember right, it did&mdash;and so did he,<br />
That wretched &lsquo;comp.,&rsquo; set at his frame, and does!<br
/>
How came it also that three months ago<br />
Your brother, the shipowner, &ldquo;sacked&rdquo; a man<br />
Out of his ship, and bade him go to hell?<br />
And in the evening up came two or three,<br />
Discreetly asking him to state the cause?<br />
And when he said he&rsquo;d see them with the other,<br />
(Videlicet, in hell), they said they feared,<br />
Unless the other came thence (if he was there),<br />
And was upon his ship to-morrow morning,<br />
It would not sail.&nbsp; It did not sail till noon,<br />
And he sailed with it!<br />
But this is all beside the point!&nbsp; Our
&lsquo;comp.,&rsquo;<br />
Who sweats there, and who will not write you
&lsquo;leaders&rsquo;<br />
Except to help a friend who&rsquo;s fallen ill,<br />
Why, he, beyond a doubt he is a fool!&rdquo;</p>

1889.&mdash;&ldquo;The promised interview with the Emperor
William was granted to-day to the delegates from the coal-miners
now on strike in Westphalia; but the audience lasted for only ten
minutes.&nbsp; The men asked that the Emperor would inquire into
the merits of their case and the hardships under which they
suffered.&nbsp; His Majesty replied that he was already inquiring
into the matter.&nbsp; He then warned the miners that he would
employ all his great powers to repress socialistic agitation and
intrigue.&nbsp; If the slightest resistance was shown he would
shoot every man so offending.&nbsp; On the other hand, he
promised to protect them if
peaceable.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Cablegram</i>.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Helpless, hopeless, bleeding, dying,<br />
All her high-born foes came round her, fleering, jeering, as they

<h3>AT THE INDIA DOCKS.<br />
<span class="smcap">A Memory of August</span>, 1883.</h3>
<p>[The spectacle of the life of the London Dock labourers is one
of the most terrible examples of the logical outcome of the
present social system.&nbsp; In the six great metropolitan docks
over 100,000 men are employed, the great bulk of whom are married
and have families.&nbsp; By the elaborate system of sub-contracts
their wages have been driven down to 4d., 3d., and even 2d. for
the few hours they are employed, making the average weekly
earnings of a man amount to 7, 6, and even 5 shillings a
week!&nbsp; Hundreds and hundreds of lives are lost or ruined
every year by the perilous nature of the work, and absolutely
without compensation.&nbsp; Yet so fierce is the competition that
men are not unfrequently maimed or even killed in the desperate
struggles at the gates for the tickets of employment,
guaranteeing a &ldquo;pay&rdquo; which often does not amount to
more than a few pence!&nbsp; The streets and houses inhabited by
this unfortunate class are of the lowest kind&mdash;haunts of
vice, disease, and death, and the monopolistic companies are thus
directly able to profit by their wholesale demoralization by
ruthlessly crushing out, through the contractors, all efforts at
organisation on the part of the men.&nbsp; To see these immense
docks, the home of that more immense machine, British Commerce,
crowded with huge and stately ships, steamers, and sailors the
first in the world, and to watch with intelligent eyes by what
means the colossal work of loading and unloading them is carried
out; this is to face a sacrificial orgy of human
life&mdash;childhood, youth, manhood, womanhood, and age, with
everything that makes them beautiful and ennobling, and not
merely a misery and a curse&mdash;far more appalling than any
Juggernaut progress or the human holocausts that were offered up
to Moloch.]</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>I stood in the ghastly gleaming
night by the swollen, sullen flow<br />
Of the dreadful river that rolls her tides through the City of
Wealth and Woe;<br />
And mine eyes were heavy with sleepless hours, and dry with
desperate grief,<br />
And my brain was throbbing and aching, and mine anguish had no
relief.<br />
For never a moment&mdash;no; not one&mdash;through all the dreary
day,<br />
And thro&rsquo; all the weary night forlorn, would the pitiless
pulses stay<br />
Of the thundering great Machinery that such insistence had,<br />
As it crushed out human hearts and souls, that it slowly drove me
mad.</p>
<p class="poetry">And there, in the dank and foetid mist, as I,
silent and tearless, stood,<br />
And the river&rsquo;s exhalations, sweating forth their muddy
blood,<br />
Breathed full on my face and poisoned me, like the slow,
putrescent drain<br />
That carries away from the shambles the refuse of flesh and
brain&mdash;<br />
There rose up slowly before me, in the dome of the city&rsquo;s
light,<br />
A vast and shadowy Substance, with shafts and wheels of might,<br
/>
Tremendous, ruthless, fatal; and I knew the visible shape<br />
Of that thundering great Machinery from which there was no
escape.</p>
<p class="poetry">It stood there high in the heavens, fronting
the face of God,<br />
And the spray it sprinkled had blasted the green and flowery
sod<br />
All round where, through stony precincts, its Cyclopean pillars
fell<br />
To its adamantine foundations that were fixed in the womb of
hell.<br />
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>And the birds that, wild and whirling, and moth-like,
flew to its glare<br />
Were struck by the flying wheel-spokes, and maimed and murdered
there;<br />
And the dust that swept about its black panoply overhead,<br />
And the din of it seemed to shatter and scatter the sheeted
dead.</p>
<p class="poetry">But mine eyes were fixed on the people that
sought this horrible den,<br />
And they mounted in thronged battalions, children and women and
men,<br />
Right out from the low horizons, more far than the eye could
see,<br />
From the north and the south and the east and the west, they came
perpetually&mdash;<br />
Some silent, some raving, some sobbing, some laughing, some
cursing, some crying,<br />
Some alone, some with others, some struggling, some dragging the
dead and the dying<br />
Up to the central Wheel enormous with its wild devouring
breath<br />
That winnowed the livid smoke-clouds and the sickening fume of
death.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then suddenly, as I watched it all, a keen wind
blew amain,<br />
And the air grew clearer and purer, and I could see it
plain&mdash;<br />
How under the central Wheel a black stone Altar stood,<br />
And a great, gold Idol upon it was gleaming like fiery blood.<br
/>
And there, in front of the Altar, was a huge, round lurid Pit,<br
/>
And the thronged battalions were marching to the yawning mouth of
it<br />
In the clangour of the Machinery and the Wheel&rsquo;s devouring
breath<br />
That winnowed the livid smoke-clouds and the sickening fume of
death.</p>
<p class="poetry"><!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>And once again as I gazed there, and
the keen wind still blew on,<br />
I saw the shape of the Idol like a king turned carrion,<br />
Yet crowned and more terrific thus for his human fleshly loss,<br
/>
And with one clenched hand he brandished a lash, and the other
held up a cross!<br />
And all around the Altar were seated, joyous and free,<br />
In garments richly-coloured and choice, a goodly company,<br />
Eating and drinking and wantoning, like gods that scorned to
know<br />
Of the thundering great Machinery and the crowds and the Pit
below.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah, Christ! the sights and the sounds there
that every hour befell<br />
Would wring the heart of the devils spinning ropes of sand in
hell,<br />
But not the insolent Revellers in their old lascivious
ease&mdash;<br />
Children hollow-eyed, starving, consumed alive with disease;<br
/>
Boys and men tortured to fiends and branded with shuddering
fire;<br />
Girls and women shrieking caught, and whored, and trampled to
death in the mire;<br />
Babyhood, youth, and manhood and womanhood that might have
been,<br />
Kneaded, a bloody pulp, to feed the gold-grinding murderous
Machine!</p>
<p class="poetry">And still, with aching eyeballs, I stared at
that hateful sight,<br />
At the long dense lines of the people and the shafts and wheels
of might,<br />
When slowly, slowly emerging, I saw a great Globe rise,<br />
Blood-red on the dim horizon, and it swam up into the skies.<br
/>
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>But whether indeed it were the sun or the moon, I could
not say,<br />
For I knew not now in my watching if it were night or day.<br />
But when that Great Globe steadied above the central Wheel,<br />
The thronged battalions wavered and paused, and an awful silence
fell.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then (I know not how, but so it was) in a
moment the flash of an eye&mdash;<br />
A murmur ran and rose to a voice, and the voice to a terrible
cry:<br />
&ldquo;Enough, enough!&nbsp; It has had enough!&nbsp; We will
march no more till we drop<br />
In the furnace Pit.&nbsp; Give us food!&nbsp; Give us rest!&nbsp;
Though the accursed Machinery stop!&rdquo;<br />
And then, with a shout of angry fear, the Revellers sprang to
their feet,<br />
And the call was for cannon and cavalry, for rifle and
bayonet.<br />
And one rose up, a leader of them, lifting a threatening rod.<br
/>
And &ldquo;Stop the Machinery!&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;you might
as well stop God!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But the terrible thunder-cry replied: &ldquo;If
this indeed must be,<br />
It is <span class="smcap">you</span> should be cast to the
furnace Pit to feed the Machine&mdash;not <span
class="smcap">we</span>!&rdquo;<br />
And the central Wheel enormous slowed down in groaning plight,<br
/>
And all the &aelig;rial movement ceased of the shafts and wheels
of might,<br />
And a superhuman clamour leaped madly to where overhead<br />
The great Globe swung in the gathering gloom, portentous, huge,
blood-red!<br />
But my brain whirled round and my blinded eyes no more could see
or know,<br />
<!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<h3>AN AUSTRALIAN POET.</h3>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Francis Adams is about the least
Australian of the Australian poets.&nbsp; There is in his work
lack of wattle-bloom and waratah, rollicking rhyme and galloping
jingle.&nbsp; There is much of old-world problems and old-world
troubles, which are old-world simply because we here have not had
time enough to breed the fever germ to a ravaging
pestilence.&nbsp; We have, however, the fever germ, and Francis
Adams does our young country yeoman service in awakening a fear
for the future in his latest book of poems, &lsquo;Songs of the
Army of the Night.&rsquo;&nbsp; The book is not all night
though.&nbsp; It is a cantata without music.&nbsp; The first part
is all gloom; angry threatening clouds bar out the light <!--
page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>of the coming dawn; footsteps of the weary and fallen
plash along in the mud and darkness; the lightning of angry
steel, gleaming phosphorescent in the night; the hoarse hum of
famished millions moiling along with a dim yearning for a bloody
vengeance, contribute the details of a grim picture of realistic
misery.&nbsp; The first part deserves the title given to the
whole book, &lsquo;Songs of the Army of the Night.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The third part is perturbed and stormy, the sea heaving and
surging after a tempest; but already the day is breaking, and
young hope is felt in the warmth of the sun&rsquo;s first
rays.&nbsp; The third part might be justly termed &lsquo;Songs of
the Dawn.&rsquo;&nbsp; The second part is hot and heavy with the
languorous heat of the tropics. . . .&nbsp; The whole book is a
hymn in praise of fodder.&nbsp; The people march hungry, hoarse
with lack of sustenance, gripping their firelocks with feverish,
skeleton hands, glaring fiercely with famished eyes towards the
granaries of the wealthy. . . .&nbsp; This is the sermon of
Nature: &lsquo;If you would be good, eat.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is in
the first part that we hear the trumpet-blast of the social
message.&nbsp; Here the verses throb with a realistic agony, a
lyric Zolaism, that chains the eyes to the page with a virile
fascination.&nbsp; It is so simple, too&mdash;the coarse, strong
meat of the poetry of first principles.&nbsp; The lines are hot
and fervid; the poet&rsquo;s pulses keep time with the great
heart of human woe.&nbsp; This is socialism in verse, anarchism
in the guise of a Grecian statue.&nbsp; &lsquo;Outside
London&rsquo; breathes thick and heavy with the vapours of
gutterdom.&nbsp; It is despair, hunger, prophecy, hate,
revenge.&nbsp; Francis Adams, a ripe and true scholar, in this
shows his devotion to truth and to art.&nbsp; The traditions of
classicism are in this volume thrown to the winds.&nbsp; The
poet&rsquo;s muse is a glorified street trull, a Cassandra of the
slums, a draggle-tailed Menad from Whitechapel, and her voice is
thick and frenzied with shouting at the barricades.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Evening Hymn in the Hovels,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Hagar,&rsquo; &lsquo;To the Girls of the Unions,&rsquo;
&lsquo;In the Edgware Road,&rsquo; &lsquo;In Trafalgar
Square,&rsquo; &lsquo;Aux Ternes,&rsquo; &lsquo;One among so
many,&rsquo; &lsquo;The New Locksley Hall,&rsquo; &lsquo;To the
Christians,&rsquo; voice in passionate, simple people&rsquo;s
lyrics the socialism which is always felt in strong
under-currents by a nation before it appears in literary form,
but which is only on the eve of bursting forth and overwhelming
everything with its fury, when it does appear in literary
form.&nbsp; Rosseau, Voltaire, and Diderot ushered in the French
Revolution; in similar fashion the English Revolution is heralded
by William Morris and Francis Adams.&rdquo;&mdash;<span

<h2>NOTES.</h2>
<p><a name="footnote27"></a><a href="#citation27"
class="footnote">[27]</a>&nbsp; In <i>The New Arcadia</i> Miss
Robinson devoted to the Cause of Labour a dilettante little book
that had not even one note of the true, the sweet and lovely
poetry of her deeper impulses.&nbsp; There is the amateur, and
the female amateur, no less in perception and emotion than in the
technical aspects of our art, and we want no more flimsy
&ldquo;sympathetic&rdquo; rigmaroles, like &ldquo;The Cry of the
Children,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Song for the Ragged Schools of
London,&rdquo; from those who, in the portraiture of the divine
simple woman&rsquo;s soul within them, can give us poetry
complete, genuine, everlasting.</p>

an example of the brilliant initiative, as the holding of the
Bloody Angle in the Wilderness is of the dauntless resolution, of
the army of the Democracy of the United States, while the last

two combatants, of whom it is enough to say that they were worthy
of one another.</p>

account of this great <i>r&eacute;volution manqu&eacute;e</i>,
which in England and 1381 went near to anticipating France and
1793, has at last found its place in the historian&rsquo;s pages,
and Longland the poet, Ball the preacher, and Tyler the man of
action, who first raised for us the democratic demand, can be
seen somewhat as they were.&nbsp; This, and more, we owe to John
Richard Green.&nbsp; An account of the Revolt will be found in
section 4 of chapter 5 of his &ldquo;Short History of the English
People.&rdquo;&nbsp; The phrases in verses 3 and 5 were
catchwords among the revolters.</p>

Melbourne as bishop in the Church of England there in 1876.&nbsp;
He almost immediately took the position of the leading religious
personality in Australia.&nbsp; To a rare geniality he added the
gifts of a &ldquo;scholar&rdquo; and a &ldquo;gentleman,&rdquo;
both real and both as modern as yet seems permitted to the old
caste and religion.&nbsp; He achieved an influence over men of
all denominations, and of none, that was quite phenomenal, and
might have been used for a national object as great as
good.&nbsp; The work of his diocese, however, proving too much
for his strength, he announced the fact, and declared that,
unless his bishopric were divided, he would be compelled to
resign it.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards he accepted the bishopric of
Manchester, on the ground that &ldquo;a larger sphere of labour
had been offered to him unsolicited.&rdquo;&nbsp; His departure
was a sort of national event.</p>

     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
